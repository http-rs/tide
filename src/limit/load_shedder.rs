/// Proportional request rejection based on load metrics.
///
/// This middleware requires the session middleware to be enabled in order to
/// track the exponential backoff value per-client.
///
/// # What is this purpose of this?
///
/// This middleware starts rejecting requests once a threshold has been reached
/// telling clients to try again. This enables a service to cope with sudden
/// increases in traffic without going down.
///
/// # How does this work?
///
/// This middleware sets a target number of requests it can process concurrently.
/// Once capacity has been achieved it starts yielding back `503: service
/// unavailable` in order to shed load. Responses also include a `Retry-After`
/// header which sets a time in the future when to retry again
///
/// Internally capacity is governed through a [PID
/// controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). This enables
/// gradually scaling up load which prevents suddenly overwhelming the system and
/// potentially crashing.
///
/// # What should clients implement?
///
/// Ideally a client will understand it can retry `503` requests, and will retry
/// with the `Retry-After` value from the response after the timeout has elapsed.
///
/// # What other mitigations can be applied?
///
/// Always use a CDN which provides DDoS protection, and correctly configure your
/// firewalls. Beyond that there are many kinds of rate limiters, and
/// [Stripe has an excellent blog post](https://stripe.com/blog/rate-limiters)
/// listing which exist and how to reason about them.
///
/// # Updating limits at runtime
///
/// Some systems may be employing an external control plane to configure the
/// limits and will want to be able to configure the load shed target too. This
/// can be done by cloning the instantiated middleware, and calling `set_target`
/// on it in response to a command from the control plane. This will update the
/// limit shared by all instances of the middleware immediately.
