/// An HTTP request handler.
///
/// This trait is automatically implemented for `Fn` types, and so is rarely implemented
/// directly by Tide users.
///
/// In practice, endpoints are functions that take a `Request<State>` as an argument and
/// return a type `T` that implements [`IntoResponse`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Endpoints are implemented as asynchronous functions that make use of language features
/// currently only available in Rust Nightly. For this reason, we have to explicitly enable
/// the attribute will be omitted in most of the documentation.
///
/// A simple endpoint that is invoked on a `GET` request and returns a `String`:
///
/// ```no_run
/// async fn hello(_req: tide::Request<()>) -> String {
///     String::from("hello")
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let mut app = tide::Server::new();
///     app.at("/hello").get(hello);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// An endpoint with similar functionality that does not make use of the `async` keyword would look something like this:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use core::future::Future;
/// fn hello(_req: tide::Request<()>) -> impl Future<Output = String> {
///     futures::future::ready(String::from("hello"))
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let mut app = tide::Server::new();
///     app.at("/hello").get(hello);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Tide routes will also accept endpoints with `Fn` signatures of this form, but using the `async` keyword has better ergonomics.
